Linked List
- Because of disadvantage of using Arrays for storing data as it is of fixed size, Expensive for Insertions and Deletions
- Linked List addresses some of issues.
- Linear Dynamic Data Structure.
- No of nodes can grow and Shrink on demand.
- Each node has Data and Reference to next node.
- Last Node has reference to NuLL.
- Entry Point is called HEAD.
- Can grow as long as possible (UNTIL SYSTEM MEMORY EXHAUSTS)
- Takes some EXTRA MEMORY for POITERS.

OPERATIONS
- INSERT
- DELETE
- DELETE ALL
- COUNT
- FIND Nth.

DISADVANTAGES
- ACCESS TIME TO ELEMENTS.
- O(n) WORST CASE
- WASTES EXTRA MEMORY FOR REFERENCE POINTS.

- INDEXING                        O(n).
- INSERT/DELETE AT BEGINING       O(1).
- INSERT/DELETE AT ENDING         O(n).
- INSERT/DELETE AT MIDDLE         O(n).
- WASTED SPACE (For POINTERS)     O(n).
